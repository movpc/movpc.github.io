---

This guide is intended to provide a clear outline of the steps required to become a notary public in the state of Missouri. It is based on the <a href="https://s1.sos.mo.gov/Business/Notary/newNotary" target="_blank">official guide</a> provided by the Missouri Secretary of State. 

<div class="alert alert-info">
While comprehensive, the official guide is hard to navigate and contains lots of legal details that don't apply to many individuals or situations. This guide provides a streamlined overview, but you may need to refer to the official guide at times.

Before beginning, you might find the [FAQ](#frequently-asked-questions) section helpful.

Each of the following steps must be completed in order. Click on a step to read about it in detail.

        <p>The <a href="https://www.sos.mo.gov/CMSImages/Business/Notary//notary_handbook.pdf" target="_blank">Missouri Notary Handbook</a> includes all details relevant to the duties of a notary in Missouri. While comprehensive, it is extremely long (104 pages) and difficult to read. The Secretary of State advises that you read the handbook before completing the notary assessment, but that is not strictly necessary.</p>

        <p>Download and open a copy of the handbook, and familiarize yourself with its Table of Contents. Then proceed to the next step.</p>

        <p>While referred to as an "assessment" or "training," this step consists simply of a series of 30 questions that you must answer while referring to the handbook. Once started, this step must be completed within 90 days. You DO NOT need to complete the assessment all at once. You may begin and return later to finish.</p>

        <p>To complete the assessment:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Visit the <a href="https://s1.sos.mo.gov/Business/Notary/Login/Login.aspx" target="_blank">training site</a> to create an account and log in</li>
            <li>Begin the training</li>
            <li>For each question in the training, refer to the handbook to learn about that topic. Then answer the question. <b>Tip:</b> To quickly find a topic in the handbook, use the <em>Find</em> feature to search by keyword. In most applications, you can search by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+F (Windows) or cmd+F (Mac).</li>
            <li>Finish the training with 6 or less incorrect answers.</li>

        <p>Once you have received your commission letter, you must purchase a surety bond. This is essentially insurance against any losses to the state of Missouri should you make an error in your duties as a notary. The bond must cover up to $10,000.</p>

        <p>Many companies sell surety bonds online. One such is <a href="https://www.missourinotary.com/missouri-notary-bond">missourinotary.com</a>, which provides a 4-year, $10,000 bond for $30.</p>

        <div class="alert alert-info">
        <p>The bond must be issued for the <em>same county</em> for which you submitted your notary application, and to which you qualify as a notary in the next step. If the county listed on your application/commission letter differs from the bond, you will not be able to qualify.</p>

        <p>For the city of St. Louis, the bond must be issued for "St. Louis City" and NOT "St. Louis."</p>

        <p>Once you have your commission letter AND your bond, you must visit your county clerk's office to complete the process. Refer to the <a href="https://s1.sos.mo.gov/Business/Notary/NotaryCountyInfo" target="_blank">Secretary of State's site</a> to find the office for your county.</p>

        <div class="alert alert-info">You must go to the <em>same county</em> listed in your application and noted on your bond.</div>

        <p>Before vising the clerk's office, call them to ask about their hours and fees. Many offices have restricted hours and specific protocols due to COVID-19, and some require an appointment in advance. Additionally, some may require payment in a certain form (e.g. St. Louis City require a $3.50 fee in exact cash). Some of this information is provided on the Secretary of State's site, but that site is not always accurate.</p>

        <p>When visiting the clerk's office, be sure to bring:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your commission letter</li>
            <li>Your surety bond</li>
            <li>Any applicable fees</li>

        <p>At the county clerk's office, they will verify your documents and obtain your signature for their files. You will then be sworn in as a notary and issued your official notary commission certificate. This is the document that verifies your legal status as a notary in Missouri, and which includes your commission #.</p>
