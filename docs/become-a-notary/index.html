While comprehensive, it is extremely long (104 pages) and difficult to read. The Secretary of State advises that you read the handbook before completing the notary assessment, but that is not strictly necessary.</p>

        <p>Download and open a copy of the handbook, and familiarize yourself with its Table of Contents. Then proceed to the next step.</p>

        <p>While referred to as an "assessment" or "training," this step consists simply of a series of 30 questions that you must answer while referring to the handbook. Once started, this step must be completed within 90 days. You DO NOT need to complete the assessment all at once. You may begin and return later to finish.</p>

        <p>To complete the assessment:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Visit the <a href="https://s1.sos.mo.gov/Business/Notary/Login/Login.aspx" target="_blank">training site</a> to create an account and log in</li>
            <li>Begin the training</li>
            <li>For each question in the training, refer to the handbook to learn about that topic. Then answer the question. <b>Tip:</b> To quickly find a topic in the handbook, use the <em>Find</em> feature to search by keyword. In most applications, you can search by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+F (Windows) or cmd+F (Mac).</li>
            <li>Finish the training with 6 or less incorrect answers.</li>

        <p>Once you have received your commission letter, you must purchase a surety bond. This is essentially insurance against any losses to the state of Missouri should you make an error in your duties as a notary. The bond must cover up to $10,000.</p>

        <p>Many companies sell surety bonds online. One such is <a href="https://www.missourinotary.com/missouri-notary-bond">missourinotary.com</a>, which provides a 4-year, $10,000 bond for $30.</p>

        <div class="alert alert-info">
        <p>The bond must be issued for the <em>same county</em> for which you submitted your notary application, and to which you qualify as a notary in the next step. If the county listed on your application/commission letter differs from the bond, you will not be able to qualify.</p>

        <p>For the city of St. Louis, the bond must be issued for "St. Louis City" and NOT "St. Louis."</p>

        <p>Once you have your commission letter AND your bond, you must visit your county clerk's office to complete the process. Refer to the <a href="https://s1.sos.mo.gov/Business/Notary/NotaryCountyInfo" target="_blank">Secretary of State's site</a> to find the office for your county.</p>

        <div class="alert alert-info">You must go to the <em>same county</em> listed in your application and noted on your bond.</div>

        <p>Before vising the clerk's office, call them to ask about their hours and fees. Many offices have restricted hours and specific protocols due to COVID-19, and some require an appointment in advance. Additionally, some may require payment in a certain form (e.g. St. Louis City require a $3.50 fee in exact cash). Some of this information is provided on the Secretary of State's site, but that site is not always accurate.</p>

        <p>When visiting the clerk's office, be sure to bring:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your commission letter</li>
            <li>Your surety bond</li>
            <li>Any applicable fees</li>
        </ul>

        <p>At the county clerk's office, they will verify your documents and obtain your signature for their files. You will then be sworn in as a notary and issued your official notary commission certificate. This is the document that verifies your legal status as a notary in Missouri, and which includes your commission #.</p>

<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3 id="how-long-does-it-take-to-become-a-notary">How long does it take to become a notary?</h3>

<p>Between a couple of weeks and 90 days. The assessment and application can be completed in a few hours. After that, it will take 7-10 days to receive your commission letter from the state. The remaining steps can be completed within a few days after receiving your letter.</p>

<p>Once you have applied, you have up to 90 days to complete the process.</p>

<h3 id="does-it-cost-anything">Does it cost anything?</h3>

<p>There are various costs associated with the process. The state of Missouri charges a $25 application fee. Surety bonds can be purchased for as little as $30, and notary supplies for as little as $30 total. Finally, county clerk offices typically charge a fee of no more than $10.</p>

<p>In total, you can expect the process of becoming a notary to cost about $100.</p>

<h3 id="how-does-becoming-a-notary-help">How does becoming a notary help?</h3>

<p>For the November 2020 election, the state of Missouri has provided for universal (that is, no reason required) mail-in ballots. However, all such ballots must be notarized. Notary Hub is helping coordinate the effort to connect notaries to voters to ensure everyone is able to vote safely.</p>
